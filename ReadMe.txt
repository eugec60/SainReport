Caio Eugenios Project

-I was able to get most of the project done but the What if analysis didnt get completed as I ran out of time.
Also the jUnit test all pass the test individually but one does not pass when they're all runned together and i couldn't firgure out why.
 UML diagram is in the uml folder. The jar file is inside the final project folder as is the java docs in the folder called doc. 

-UML Diagram is complete and is under the UML Folder 
-Program is complete, but is missing a What IF analysis 
	-has user Authentication (to login as admin ************UserName= "Admin" password="Password"**************
	-Search funcion complete
	-Sain Report can be updated
	-Save and load is complete
	-Gui interface was built with JAVAfx  
- My program follows gogle Jaca Coding style 
- It has Java Doc tags for all the class and methods Also has in Line Commenting 
-Java Doc is created and is under the doc folder
-My Github has commits dating back to April 20 th so that is complete
- Program also has some JUnit test Cases
-Runnable jar File is created and is added to the Project folder.

Overall the only thing missing is a what if analysis so I would take a couple poits off for that.
I had fun working on the project and it was definitely a learning experience. I got a lot out of it. Thanks for the assignment.
