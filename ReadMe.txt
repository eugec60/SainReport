Caio Eugenios Project

-I was able to get most of the project done but the What if analysis didnt get completed as I ran out of time.
Also the jUnit test all pass the test individually but one does not pass when they're all runned together and i couldn't firgure out why.
 UML diagram is in the uml folder. The jar file is inside the final project folder as is the java docs in the folder called doc doc.
